This project was built to solidify JavaScript fundamentals before learning React. Through this project, I gained deep understanding of:

- Event-driven programming
- Data flow and state management
- Asynchronous event handling
- Array manipulation and transformation
- Form handling and validation
- Debugging with browser console
